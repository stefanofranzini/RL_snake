## Fruit Hunter

The agent must hunt down each randomly spawning fruit
in the least steps. it moves in the four directions on
a n x n grid (with n being chosen during the setup).

Hence we have

n x n agent's positions

n x n fruit's positions

for a total n^4 states

The agent can take 4 actions in each position (the boundaries of the
grid are periodic).

The tables will contain n^4 x 4 entries.
